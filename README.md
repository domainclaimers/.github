# DOMAIN CLAIMERS!
## What do we do?
We claim domains (free ones mostly) and reserve them to use later without it being taken.
## Why are there loads of repositories?
Due to some applications only letting us deploy one repo at a time. (only one time use kinda)
## Isn't this some sort of violation to any rules?
Most likely yes, but we'll do it still to populate our websites for when some people want to browse the web by editing the url a bit.
